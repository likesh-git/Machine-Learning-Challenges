bluegills.csv ( Polynomial Regression)

How is the length of a bluegill fish related to its age?

In 1981, n = 78 bluegills were randomly sampled from Lake Mary in Minnesota. 
The researchers (Cook and Weisberg, 1999) measured and recorded the following data (Import bluegills.csv File)

Response variable(Dependent): length (in mm) of the fish

Potential Predictor (Independent Variable): age (in years) of the fish

How is the length of a bluegill fish best related to its age? (Linear/Quadratic nature?)
What is the length of a randomly selected five-year-old bluegill fish? Perform polynomial regression on the dataset.

NOTE: Observe that 80.1% of the variation in the length of bluegill fish is reduced by taking into account a quadratic function of the age of the fish.
